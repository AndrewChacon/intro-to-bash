myname="Andrew"
echo "Hello World!"

we use a '$' to signify were using a variable
echo $myname -> prints var
echo myname  -> prints string 

printing an undecleared variable results in nothing
echo $newvar -> 

ls and $ls - tells difference between vars and commands
this helps us avoid name collisions, regardless, its manditory

printing a variable in a string, use double quotes.
single quotes will print out the name of the variable, not the contents of the variable.
